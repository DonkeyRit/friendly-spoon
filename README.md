# ü§ñ Your Telegram Bot Name

This application is a Telegram bot that filters messages from other Telegram channels based on user-defined criteria. It is built using Java and integrates with the Telegram Database Library (tdlib) to receive messages from specific chats. The application is designed to be scalable and supports a large number of simultaneous interactions.

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured around a microservices architecture, with the following main components:

- **Bot Service:** Handles interactions with the Telegram Bot API.
- **Subscription Service:** Manages user subscriptions to channels and uses tdlib to receive messages.
- **Filter Service:** Applies filters to messages and forwards filtered messages.
- **Notification Service:** Sends filtered messages to the user's Telegram bot.
- **Database:** Stores user subscriptions and filter criteria.
- **Message Queue:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between services (e.g., Apache Kafka).

## Features

- Subscribe to specific channels
